# ↗ Learning Next.js ⚡
I took the [React Foundations course](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations) on the Next.js website to learn about React concepts and a little bit about front-end development.
## Topics learned
- Document Object Model (DOM)
- User Interface rendering and manipulation using Javascript
- Minimizing repetitive code using React
- React Components with Props
- React States
- Server vs Client Components (Next.js automatically forces Server Components to help with website performance)
## Next step
Learning how to use pure Next.js [on another repository here](https://github.com/anhnlh/nextjs-dashboard).
